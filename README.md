# RayTracer: A Photorealistic Ray Tracing Renderer

## Introduction
This project is an advanced ray tracer developed as part of the Computer Graphics course (Spring 2023). It follows a structured implementation of ray tracing, supporting Blinn-Phong shading, reflections, refractions, texture mapping, bounding volume hierarchies (BVH), and distributed ray tracing. The goal is to create photorealistic renderings while optimizing performance.

This implementation is inspired by **Ray Tracing in One Weekend**, Scratchapixel, YouTube tutorials, and various GitHub projects. Below is a structured workflow for the development process.

## Features Implemented

### Basic Ray Tracing
- **Pinhole Camera**: Implements a simple pinhole camera model for rendering.
- **Point Light Source**: Enables basic illumination.
- **Ray-Shape Intersections**:
  - Sphere: Implements ray-sphere intersection using quadratic solutions.
  - Planar Quad: Computes intersection using normal vectors and plane equations.
  - Triangle: Uses barycentric coordinates to determine if a ray hits the triangle.
  - Triangle Meshes: Reads and processes PLY files to form complex objects.
- **Blinn-Phong Shading**: A fundamental shading model for realistic rendering.

### Advanced Features
- **Texture Mapping**:
  - Sphere, Planar Quad, Triangle, Triangle Meshes
  - Implements UV coordinate transformations
- **Reflection and Refraction**: Supports mirror-like reflections and glass-like materials using secondary rays.
- **Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH)** (In progress): Accelerates ray-object intersections for improved performance.
- **Distributed Ray Tracing**:
  - Depth of Field (Thin Lens Camera Model)
  - Soft Shadows (Area Light Source)
  - Random vs. Jittered Sampling Comparison
- **Custom Scene**: A showcase of implemented features with complex object arrangements.

## Implementation Details
### 1. Workflow
The ray tracing process follows these steps:
1. **Scene Parsing**: Reads scene data from JSON input files, extracting objects, lights, and camera properties.
2. **Ray Generation**: Computes primary rays from the camera.
3. **Intersection Testing**: Uses mathematical formulations for ray-object intersections.
4. **Shading & Lighting**: Implements Blinn-Phong shading using diffuse and specular components.
5. **Recursive Ray Tracing**: Handles reflections and refractions based on material properties.
6. **Texture Mapping**: Maps 2D textures onto 3D objects using calculated UV coordinates.
7. **Optimization**: Implements basic acceleration structures and prepares for BVH integration.
8. **Rendering & Output**: Generates a final `.ppm` image output.

### 2. UML Class Structure
This project follows an object-oriented approach, structured according to the provided UML diagram. Key classes include:
- `RayTracer`: Core engine handling scene setup and rendering.
- `Camera`: Base class for Pinhole and Thin Lens cameras.
- `LightSource`: Defines point and area light sources.
- `Shape`: Abstract base class for all geometric primitives.
- `TriangleMesh`: Reads and processes PLY files.
- `BVH` (Planned): Implements a bounding volume hierarchy for efficient intersection testing.

## Usage Instructions
### 1. Build and Run
Ensure you have `CMake` installed, then execute the following commands:
```sh
cd /path/to/RayTracer
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./raytracer <input.json>
```
### 2. Example Usage
```sh
./raytracer scenes/sample_scene.json
```
The output will be saved as a `.ppm` image file.

## Results & Performance
- The final rendered image showcases various features such as reflections, refractions, soft shadows, and texture mapping.
- Performance comparison with and without BVH demonstrates significant speedup in rendering.
- Jittered sampling reduces noise in distributed ray tracing compared to random sampling.
